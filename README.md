# Java Multiple Classes - Bus Stop
The app was produced using a Test Driven Design approach. The aims of the app were the following:

* Create a Bus class with a Destination, Capacity and an initially empty ArrayList passengers of type Person
* Create a method to return the number of passengers on the bus.
* Create a method to add a passenger onto the bus only if the passenger count is less than the capacity.
* Create a method to remove a passenger from the bus.
* Add a BusStop class which interacts with the other two.
